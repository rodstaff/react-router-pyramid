#react-router-pyramid

This is an experiment.

There are two branches here:  "master" and "pyramid"

###  This is the "pyramid" branch.  This combines 'react-router' app
with 'reduxpyramid' app/ but separately.

There are two remote repositories, one for each branch:

master =>   "origin"	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-app.git
pyramid =>  "pyr"   	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-pyramid.git
