#react-router-pyramid

This is an experiment...

There are three branches here:  "master", "pyramid" and "reactx".

###  This is the "pyramid" branch.  Here, the 'react-router' is added SEPARATELY 
to 'reduxpyramid' app/; i.e. not included in 'reducers'/store'.

There are two remote repositories, one for each branch:

master =>   "origin"	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-app.git
pyramid =>  "pyr"   	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-pyramid.git
reactx =>   "rx"    	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-redux.git
